# Kaggle GPU Training

I trained my model on Kaggle's free GPU with large datasets.

## Files

- `train_model.py` - Complete training script for Kaggle
- `KAGGLE_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup instructions

## Quick Start

1. Create Kaggle notebook with GPU enabled
2. Copy `train_model.py` code
3. Run training (5-15 minutes on GPU)
4. Download model files
5. Add to your project's `public/` folder

See [KAGGLE_SETUP.md](./KAGGLE_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.
